"""effective_ebops: measure the EBOPs coefficient the training loss actually minimizes.

Background: the Polaris beta sweep was calibrated from `total_ebops` and came out inert
-- four decades of beta moved the mean learned bitwidth by 0.01%. Cause: `quant_losses()`
is affine in beta with a slope that is ~5 orders of magnitude below `total_ebops`, because
most of the reported total comes from QSoftmax layers whose cost never enters the
regularization loss. `effective_ebops` measures the slope instead.

Discriminating properties, each with the wrong implementation it catches:
- affine: the fitted (slope, floor) predicts quant_loss at a *third*, unprobed beta --
  catches a function that returns plausible-looking but unrelated numbers.
- distinct: the slope is orders of magnitude below `total_ebops` -- catches "fixing" this
  by aliasing it to total_ebops, which is exactly the bug that caused the inert sweep.
- restores: layer betas are unchanged afterwards -- catches a probe that silently leaves
  the model perturbed, which would corrupt a training run that called it mid-flight.
- calibrates: beta derived as f*L/E_eff really does make the resource term f*L --
  catches sign and scale errors in the fit.
