"""The optimizer must receive the model's Dense kernels, not just quantizer state.

Keras 3 on the torch backend keeps layer weights as keras `Variable`s whose `.value` is
an `nn.Parameter` that is never registered on the `nn.Module`. Building an optimizer from
`named_parameters()` therefore silently omits every kernel in the model -- measured on the
CLIC config: 282 kernel/bias tensors, 11.6M elements, all receiving gradients, none
optimized. Training then only moves quantizer state and a handful of norm/query tensors.

Discriminating properties, each with the wrong implementation it catches:
- covers: every trainable kernel/bias is in a group -- catches the original bug exactly.
- classified: kernels land in the non-quantizer group, bitwidths in the quantizer group --
  catches a fix that dumps everything into one group and applies weight decay to bitwidths.
- deduplicated: no tensor appears twice -- `keras_layers()` aggregates sublayer weights, so
  a naive concatenation double-registers and double-applies each update.
- excludes beta: the regularization strength is never optimized -- its 'gradient' is just
  the EBOPs magnitude.
- steps: an optimizer built from these groups actually changes a kernel.
